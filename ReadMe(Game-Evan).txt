The objective of “Tetromino'' is to clear as many lines as possible and avoid hitting the top with the pieces given. What I changed about the code is that there are now options on both the “Tetromino'' screen and “Pause” screen with it stating “Press T to Start” and “Press C for Controls”. I added Grids to the main game to allow for users to see where the pieces are going to fall and a border around the Next Piece. I added a timer and a background to the “Game Over” screen to prevent users from accidentally pressing a button and immediately starting a new game. The Control Screen displays the controls used for the game for a short period of time before sending the user into the game. I made the Falling Frequency slower to make it easier for users to play the game.
