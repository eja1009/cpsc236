The objective of “Simulate” is to match the pattern that the computer generates for you.
There are four colored squares that the user can input to match the flashes generated by the computer. The user has a time limit to input their response, and if they don’t enter it fast enough, they lose. Another way to lose is by inputting the wrong pattern, which doesn’t match the computer’s. The changes I made to the code include changing it to two-person local multiplayer instead of single player and adding “challenge levels” every 5 rounds. In the multiplayer, it takes turns between players to let them input the pattern in each round. If they get it right, they increase their individual scores. In the challenge rounds, the computer’s pattern flashes faster and the user has less time to input their response.
